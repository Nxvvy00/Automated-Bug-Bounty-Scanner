## Introduction

The **Automated Bug Bounty Scanner** is an educational project aimed at providing insights into web application security. This tool automates the process of identifying common vulnerabilities, making it easier for security researchers and developers to improve their applications. It is built using Python and Lua, leveraging the strengths of both languages for web scraping and data processing.

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Quickly identify vulnerabilities without manual intervention.
- **Brute-Force Capabilities**: Test for weak passwords and common exploits.
- **Information Gathering**: Collect data about the target website to enhance your scanning efforts.
- **Educational Tool**: Learn about web security while using the scanner.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation to help you get started.

## Installation

To get started with the Automated Bug Bounty Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nxvvy00/Automated-Bug-Bounty-Scanner.git
   cd Automated-Bug-Bounty-Scanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Nxvvy00/Automated-Bug-Bounty-Scanner/releases) section to download the latest version. Extract the files and execute the scanner.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the scanner. Here‚Äôs a simple command to run the tool:

```bash
python scanner.py --target <target-url>
```

Replace `<target-url>` with the URL of the website you want to scan. The scanner will begin analyzing the target for vulnerabilities.

### Example Commands

- To scan a specific website:
  ```bash
  python scanner.py --target http://example.com
  ```

- To enable verbose output:
  ```bash
  python scanner.py --target http://example.com --verbose
  ```

- To save the results to a file:
  ```bash
  python scanner.py --target http://example.com --output results.txt
  ```

## Getting Started with Web Security

### Understanding Vulnerabilities

Web applications can be vulnerable to various attacks. Here are some common types:

1. **SQL Injection**: Attackers can manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access to data.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Attackers can trick users into executing unwanted actions on a different site.
4. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

### Best Practices for Secure Coding

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Use Prepared Statements**: For database queries, use prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection risks.
- **Implement Proper Authentication**: Use strong password policies and two-factor authentication to secure user accounts.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep your libraries and frameworks up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The **Automated Bug Bounty Scanner** is a powerful tool for anyone interested in web security. By automating the scanning process, it allows users to focus on fixing vulnerabilities rather than finding them.
